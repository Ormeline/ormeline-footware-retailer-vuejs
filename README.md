# Footware Retailer Listing Page using Vue.js (improved)

You are provided with a set of products and are required to create a products listing page for a footwear retailer. 

### Implement the following functionality and styling:

- Lay out all products in a responsive product grid
- Create a filter toggle that shows only available products
- Create a checkbox brand filter that shows only toggled brand products
- Add a counter for the number of resulting products
- Create a dropdown to sort all products into ascending or descending price order
- Add an option to sort all products by relevance - with all available products shown first in ascending rank order, then all unavailable products in ascending rank order.
- You will be assessed on both behaviour and design. Don't spend more than 2 hours on this.
